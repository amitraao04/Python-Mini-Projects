# How It Works
# In Wordle, your objective is to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. Here's how you play:

# Make a Guess: Start by typing in any five-letter word you think might be the secret word.

# Get Feedback: After each guess, you'll receive color-coded feedback:

# ðŸŸ© Green: The letter is in the correct position.
# ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
# â¬› Black: The letter isn't in the word at all.
# Use the Clues: Use these clues to refine your next guesses. Keep guessing until you find the secret word or run out of attempts.

# 1) Import random.
# 2) Define a list of sample words.
# 3) Define the isword function to compare the guessed word with the target word and provide feedback.
# 4) Select a random word from the list of sample words.
# 5) Print a welcome message.
# 6) Define congratulatory messages for successful guesses and set attempts to 6.
# 7) Start a game loop that runs while attempts are greater than 0:
# 8) Prompt the user to enter a 5-letter word.
# 9) Validate the input and call the isword function if valid.
# 10) Print a congratulatory message and break the loop if the word is correct.
# 11) Print an error message if the input is invalid.
# 12) Print the correct word if all attempts are exhausted.
# â¬› ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¨
